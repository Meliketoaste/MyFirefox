-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To choose between XS, S, L (vertical tabs size)

- go to userChrome.css
- change [ @import url(theme/all-global-theme.css); ] to:

- XS [ @import url(theme/all-global-theme-xs.css); ]
- S [ @import url(theme/all-global-theme-s.css); ]
- L [ @import url(theme/all-global-theme.css); ]

- to switch between color schemes I recommend downloading the themes individually, however you can force change in userChrome.css, 
- find color schemes folder and copy and paste the respective files into your themes folder.
